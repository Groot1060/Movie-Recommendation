#Introduction

This project aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by utilizing machine learning techniques to recommend movies tailored to individual preferences. The recommendation system is built on a collaborative filtering approach, which considers the preferences and behaviors of similar users to make accurate suggestions.

# Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a straightforward interface for users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.

- **Scalability:** The recommendation engine is designed to scale efficiently, allowing it to handle a large number of users and movies.

- **Customization:** Users can customize their recommendations by providing explicit feedback on movies they've watched or liked.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The system employs collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate accurate movie suggestions.

# Installation

To install and run the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

# Usage

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Input your movie preferences or provide feedback on recommended movies.
3. Receive personalized movie recommendations based on your input.

# Data

The project uses a sample dataset containing information about users, movies, and user ratings. You can replace this dataset with your own data for a more personalized recommendation system.

# Algorithms

The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering algorithms, specifically user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, to analyze user preferences and generate accurate movie suggestions.
